# Range List Challenge
`SegmentIntensityManager` manages intensities for segments on a number line.

- The entire number line starts with intensity 0. 
- Segments can go from -infinity to infinity. 
- The `add(from, to, amount)` and `set(from, to, amount)` functions update a segment's intensity by the given amount.
